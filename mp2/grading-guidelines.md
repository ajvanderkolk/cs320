# Machine Project 2 - Grading Guidelines

## Grading Process

### Timelines for Grading

* The day after the regular deadline: grading process starts.
* Five days after the hard deadline: TAs finish grading.
* Within one week after the hard deadline: grades posted to Canvas and start collecting regrade requests
* Students can submit regrade requests through the Project Grading Issue Form.
    * The regrade requests are only for TA's mistakes in manual grading.
    * Please do not submit any regrade requests until grades are posted to Canvas.
* One week after the grade release on Canvas: we will stop collecting regrade requests.
* One week after closing regrade requests for projects: TAs will contact you for regrade request results.

### Deduction Decisions

* We will only grade individual portion.
* We will deduct points for hardcoding and not following directions.
* Other bugs may receive written feedback with no deduction.
* We will try to include at least one inline comment about how to improve the code for each studentâ€™s submission, even for the ones with a perfect score.

## Rubric for MP2

### Deduction Reasons

**Q6 - Q10**
* Hardcoding (e.g., directly displaying final solution): -5 points for each question

**Q6**
* Too few data samples (< 3): -3 points

**Q6 - Q8**
* Missing x-label or y-label: -1 point (only deduct once for all three plots)
* Wrong figure shape: -2 points for each question
    * Q6 should follow a linear trend
    * Q7 loop should spend way more time than BST
    * Q6 and Q7 can have fluctuating milliseconds (or one or two outliers) because the time function depends on the environment of the VM
    * Q8 should have the exact same shape/value because the count is computed from the same dataset
